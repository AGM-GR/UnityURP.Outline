## Description

Requires Unity 6.0.20 or higher.
Compatible with Universal Render Pipeline.<br>

This repository is a fork of [Per-Object_Outline_RenderGraph_RendererFeature_Example](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Per-Object_Outline_RenderGraph_RendererFeature_Example), aiming to improve it and create a production ready solution.<br>

UnityURP.Outline create a soft object-outline effect in Universal Render Pipeline - Unity 6+ as a Render Feature using RenderGraph and RenderPasses. Allows you to specify individual Renderers instead of filtering them from the entire scene as would be done with DrawRendererList.<br>
