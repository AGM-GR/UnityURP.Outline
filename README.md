# Per-Object Outlines: A RenderGraph RendererFeature Example
Using some custom shaders and a modified version of [the URP example custom RenderGraph RendererFeature](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.render-pipelines.universal@17.0/manual/renderer-features/create-custom-renderer-feature.html) to create a soft object-outline effect in Unity 6, which allows you to specify individual Renderers instead of filtering them from the entire scene as would be done with DrawRendererList.<br/>

Demonstrated at Unity Dev Day Seattle, 2024.
